# orbital-renderer
An implementation of my (n-Renderer)[https://github.com/De-Zwaan/n-Renderer] library to render atomic and possibly molecular orbits using marching cubes and rasterisation.

To build and run fhe code, install Rust and Cargo as described (here)[https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install]. Clone the source and in the directory with the source code, run `cargo run --release`.
